Tune is a simple command-line tool for generating sine waves of a given note
or frequency it uses SDL to output and can dump the raw samples to a file.  
Not much more to say :)

Convert raw samples like:

  aplay -c 1 -f S16_[LE|BE] -r 44100 sinewave.raw

And encode them with ffmpeg:

  ffmpeg -f u16le -acodec pcm_s16le -i sinewave.raw -acodec pcm_s16le -ac 1 output.wav
